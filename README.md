# odfiles

macOS configuration for Opendoor employees.

## getting started

> Note: these dotfiles use 24 bit (true) color. For best results use a compatible terminal emulator, here are a few possibilities: [`Alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [`iTerm2` (macOS-specific)](https://iterm2.com/).

The below commands will run the [`infra/setup/setup_dotfiles`](./infra/setup/setup_dotfiles) setup script.

This script will walk through installing various shell utilities, symlinking various files to their appropriate locations, etc. See [`infra/setup`](./infra/setup/) folder for documentation on the setup process.

```bash
cd $HOME # to clone dotfiles to `$HOME/odfiles`
# now clone this repo and run setup
git clone https://github.com/opendoor-labs/odfiles.git .odfiles
cd .odfiles
make setup
```

Unless something went wrong (ðŸ¤ž) you're all set up now! ðŸŽ‰
