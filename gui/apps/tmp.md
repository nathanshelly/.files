# apps

A [Brewfile](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/brewfile-a-gemfile-but-for-homebrew) for easy installation of all GUI apps I use (Homebrew calls them casks).

Settings/keybindings files for to configure a subset of those apps.

## [Brewfile](./Brewfile)

Lists the casks (desktop apps) to install via Homebrew.

## List of apps

- [alacritty](./alacritty) - a cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator
- [alt-tab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/) - a Spotlight/Alfred alternative
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - a better replacement for [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014)
- [iTerm](./iterm) - a macOS terminal emulator
- [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle) - move/resize applications with keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl-Option-Cmd-j` moves and resizes focused application to vertical left half of screen)
- [ueli](https://github.com/oliverschwendener/ueli) - a Spotlight/Alfred alternative
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Microsoft's text editor. Rarely used since [`neovim`](https://neovim.io) is my primary editor but convenient to have configured as I like when I want it.
