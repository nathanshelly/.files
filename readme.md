# .files

My personal dotfiles configuration for macOS & Linux systems.

Primarily a [`zsh`](https://www.zsh.org), [`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) & [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) workflow (respective folders: [`zsh`](./zsh), [`neovim`](./neovim) & [`tmux`](./tmux)).

## why use this?

Custom dotfiles can make your terminal setup far more powerful (& prettier).

They can also suck up your time following a rabbit hole of Stack Overflow posts, break in unexpected ways, and generally be a chore to build.

These dotfiles give you the best of a custom configuration without the hassle of maintenance.

### the pitch

- features
  - [fuzzy searching anything and everything](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77736063-e9826280-6fc8-11ea-9cde-c1d785a15ac5.gif) via [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (see additional possibilities [here](./utilities/fzf/README.md))
  - [easy completion/execution of most recent matching command](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77734491-0701fd00-6fc6-11ea-88a8-7050762d1302.gif) via [`zsh-autosuggestions`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/)
  - [syntax highlighting as you type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77735358-a83d8300-6fc7-11ea-9be4-faab8443fb60.gif) (immediate feedback on invalid commands, flags, paths, etc.) via [`fast-syntax-highlighting`](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting)
  - [syntax highlighted `git diff`s](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77733162-a5409380-6fc3-11ea-9f7a-59db41d058df.png) via [`delta`](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
  - [syntax highlighted `cat`ting of files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77732987-4da22800-6fc3-11ea-9cc2-79f0643e9645.png) via [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  - [highlighted `man` pages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9750687/77732882-116ec780-6fc3-11ea-83e9-0e1743963536.png) via [a few `TERMCAP` vars](https://github.com/nathanshelly/.files/blob/ba5fc4e/zsh/zshenv#L34-L45)
  - [a blazing-fast async prompt](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/) with contextual information like `git` changes, executable versions, etc.
    - customizable via the command `p10k configure`
  - [useful utilities](./utilities/README.md) like [`z.lua`](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua), [`rg`](./utilities/ripgrep/README.md), [`fzf`](./utilities/fzf/README.md), [`fd`](./utilities/fd/README.md), etc.
- best practices/sane defaults - dotfiles configuration is weird. At times the documentation seems like ancient, undecipherable text. Things break in wild, unexpected maddening ways. Sometimes the suggestions you see on Stack Overflow seem like magic incantations. These dotfiles deal with all of that for you so you don't need to worry about it (and if you do run into weirdness help is only an issue away!).

  > disclaimer: These dotfiles can always be improved. The claim of best practices comes primarily from the sheer volume of time poured into them, not any pretension that they are perfect.

- well-supported - no SLA but a promise to address new issues in a timely manner ⏰
- well-documented - READMEs & code comments galore help anytime you want to make direct changes
- focus on speed - this configuration attempts to provide a useful set of features while keeping shell startup/prompt latency as low as possible
- customizable - toggle bits & pieces, set a color theme (light or dark), and more via a [`.files-settings` file](./infra/docs/settings.md)

### the anti-pitch

- 'mo code, 'mo problems - additional dependencies can cause headaches and add complexity or fragility that outweighs the benefits
- no single dotfiles configuration is best for everyone - these dotfiles were written with my use cases in mind. They will hopefully work for yours (or at least the parts that do can be adopted for your own config); they won't work for everyone's

### .files values

Aspirational principles:

- reliable - avoid fragile dependencies & configuration. Breaking someone's shell (in subtle or unsubtle ways) is far worse than not having a given feature.
- customizable - support different configurations for different users (without adding too much additional complexity/fragility)
- passively useful - be useful & worthwhile without learning any aliases or keybindings, modifying any settings or reading any documentation
- respectful of defaults - make non-standard modifications (e.g. overwriting commonly used bindings) opt-in/easily configurable wherever possible

## quickstart

> If you use docker you can run the following command to test drive this config with minimal effort (see [`misc/docker/dotfiles`](./misc/docker/dotfiles) for more details):
>
> `docker run --interactive --tty nathanshelly/dotfiles:latest`

These dotfiles use 24 bit (true) color. For best results use a terminal emulator that supports this feature (the default macOS emulator, `Terminal`, does **not**). Here are a few possibilities: [`Alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [`iTerm2` (macOS-specific)](https://iterm2.com/).

The below commands will run the [`infra/setup/setup_dotfiles`](./infra/setup/setup_dotfiles) which will walk through installing shell utilities, symlinking files to their appropriate locations, etc. See the [`infra/setup`](./infra/setup/) folder for documentation on the setup process.

```bash
cd $HOME # to clone dotfiles to `$HOME/.files`
# now clone this repo and run setup
git clone https://github.com/nathanshelly/.files.git
cd .files
make setup
```

Unless something went wrong (🤞) you're all set up now! 🎉

## next steps

### add your own configuration

If you have your own shell configuration (a `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.) you will likely be able to simply source it and get the best of this config while overriding with your own.

> Note: `zsh` is mostly backwards compatible with `bash`. Enough so that most `bash` configs can be sourced from `zsh` without any issues. If you have a more complex `bash` config there may be compatibility issues.

To do so, simply move or copy the file to `$DOTFILES/zsh/local.zsh`. For example, if you want to preserve configuration from a `.bashrc` you'd run the following:

```bash
# or `mv`
cp $HOME/.bashrc $DOTFILES/zsh/local.zsh
source $HOME/.zshrc
```

Your configuration should now be applied on top of these dotfiles. Feel free to open an issue if you have any trouble!

### add secrets safely

**DO NOT** check in any tokens or credentials like `NPM_TOKEN`s, database URLs, etc. To avoid this, add such secrets to the gitignored `$DOTFILES/zsh/secrets.zsh` (you'll need to create it the first time you want to add a secret).

> Technically `$DOTFILES/zsh/local.zsh` is gitignored as well but splitting out secrets into a separate file can help avoid accidental leakage.

### explore features/configuration

Here's a few items you might be interested in trying/learning more about:

- configure high-level features of these dotfiles (changing the theme, setting your editor, disabling the prompt, etc.) via the [settings](./infra/docs/settings.md)
- configure your prompt appearance via `p10k configure` (or disable the prompt altogether via the `prompt` setting from the previous bullet point)
- use [`fzf` keybindings](./utilities/fzf/README.md#keybindings) to speed up so many things from quickly fuzzily selecting files, find zsh history items you half-remember typing weeks ago, checking out the commit from the one keyword you remember typing in the commit message & more
- use `z <directory-fragment>` to quickly jump to frequently/recently visited directories from anywhere
  - for example, `z down` to jump to downloads or `z .f` to jump to this directory
