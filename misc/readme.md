# misc

A grab bag of config for which I could find no better place.

- [`docker`](./docker) - experiments with docker, try running these [dotfiles in a docker container](./docker/dotfiles)
- [`formatters`](./formatters) - autoformatter configs
- [`macos`](./macos) - `macOS`-specific config, currently just packages unneeded on Linux
- [`ssh`](./ssh) - holds my `ssh` config
