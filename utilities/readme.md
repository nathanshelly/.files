# utilities

Resources for various utilities

- [`bat`](#bat) - a prettier `cat` with syntax highlighting, line numbers, git highlights and paging
- [`exa`](./exa) - a prettier `ls` with friendlier defaults
- [`git`](./git) - version control of choice
- [`fd`](#fd) - a faster `find` with friendlier defaults
- [`fzf`](./fzf) - easily fuzzily filter any list (files, directories, git branches, etc.)
- [`ripgrep`](./ripgrep) - a faster `grep` with friendlier defaults
- [`z.lua`](https://github.com/skywind3000/z.lua) - quickly `cd` to folders based on frequency and recency of access

Wrote up [an explainer](https://gist.github.com/nathanshelly/4b7020d09d413cab823914b06162145a) that covers most of these plus a few others

## utilities w/o a separate README

### [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)

`asdf` is an extendable version manager that supports a variety of languages and tools. Sort of a one-version-manager-to-rule-them-all idea.

To specify versions for a project one creates a `.tool-versions` file at the root of the project with the languages/tools and their respective versions.

For example:

```shell
nodejs 10.15.3
python 3.8.0
```

The first time you work in that project run `asdf install` to set up your environment and you're all done.

#### [`tool-versions`](../tool-versions)

Symlinked to `$HOME/.tool-versions` by [`$DOTFILES/infra/setup/bin/symlink`](../../infra/setup/bin/symlink).

This file specifies the global versions of tools to use if there is no other `.tool-versions` file between the current directory and `$HOME`.

### [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) ðŸ¦‡

A prettier cat with syntax highlighting, line numbers, git highlights and paging.

### [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

A simpler, faster `find` (`fd` is to `find` as `ripgrep` is to `grep`). Skips hidden directories, respects `.gitignore` files, colorized terminal output, smart case (case-insensitive by default, case sensitive if pattern includes a capital).

Here is a heads up comparison on an arbitrary query:

```zsh
find . -iname '*TradeInStep*' -not -path '*/node_modules/*'
# or
fd TradeInStep
```

A few other usage examples:

```zsh
# search for files matching pattern (no more `find . -iname '*PATTERN*'`)
fd pattern

# include hidden and ignored files
fd --hidden --no-ignore pattern
```
