# apps

Brewfile for casks & settings/keybindings files for various apps (primarily native).

## [Brewfile](./Brewfile)

Lists the casks (desktop apps) to install via Homebrew. See additional context on Brewfiles in [`$DOTFILES/Brewfile`](../Brewfile).

## List of apps

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - a better replacement for [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014)
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) - move/resize applications with keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl-Option-Cmd-j` moves and resizes focused application to vertical left half of screen)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Microsoft's text editor. Rarely used since [`neovim`](https://neovim.io) is my primary editor but convenient to have configured as I like when I want it.
