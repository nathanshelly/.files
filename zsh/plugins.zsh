# `zinit` has a concept called ice modifiers which applies single-use
# modifiers to the next loaded plugin.
#
# the `ice` name communicates that the modifiers last for only the next zinit
# command
#
# here are the modifiers used in this file:
#
# - wait - load asynchronously
# - atload - command to run when the plugin finishes loading
# - lucid - skip `Loaded ...` message
