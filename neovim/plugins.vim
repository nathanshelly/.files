" << motions/operators >>

" < both operators and motions >

" a grab bag of useful normal mode keybindings
"
" here are the ones that interest me enough to install this (time will tell if I
" actually use any of them):
"
" - `[f` - open preceding file alphabetically in the current file's directory
" - `]f` - open succeeding file alphabetically in the current file's directory
" - `<count>[<Space>` - add <count> blank lines above cursor
" - `<count>]<Space>` - add <count> blank lines below cursor
" - `<count>[e` - exchange current line with <count> lines above
" - `<count>]e` - exchange current line with <count> lines below
" - `[p` - paste above the cursor maintaining indentation
" - `[p` - paste below the cursor maintaining indentation
" - `[u<motion>` or `[uu` - URL encode, e.g. foo bar => foo%20bar
" - `]u<motion>` or `]uu` - URL decode, e.g. foo bar => foo%20bar

" < operators >

" edit surrounding characters
"
" - `ys<motion/text object><character>` - surround with given character. For
"     example, `ysiw'` on `word` will add surrounding `'`s -> `'word'`.
" - `ds<character>` - delete nearest (innermost) surrounding pair of given
"     character. For example, `ds(` on `(word)` will delete surrounding `()`s ->
"     `word`.
" - `cs<character-to-replace><new-character>` - change nearest (innermost)
"     surrounding pair of valid surrounding characters into any other valid
"     surrounding character pairing. For example, `cs"<` on `"word"` changes the
"     `"`s into `<>` -> `<word>`
"
" See further usage examples - https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'

" comment code - `gc<motion>`
Plug 'tpope/vim-commentary'

" converts between number representations - decimal <> hex <> octal <> binary
" - `gA` shows all representations of the number under the cursor
" - `crd`, `crx`, `cro` & `crb` convert the number under the cursor to decimal,
"    hex, octal & binary, respectively
" note: `vim-magnum` is a dependency of `vim-radical`
Plug 'glts/vim-magnum' | Plug 'glts/vim-radical'

" replace - `<register>gr<motion>`, replaces motion text with contents of given
" register (unnamed register (`_`) if none given)
Plug 'vim-scripts/ReplaceWithRegister'

" sort w/ `gs<motion>`
" e.g. `gs2k` sorts down two lines (current + 2 below)
Plug 'christoomey/vim-sort-motion'

" < text objects >
" note: curently no motion plugins installed

" this plugin is a dependency for other `kana/vim-textobj-*`
"
" see issue explaining for vim-textobj-line
" - https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-line/issues/5
"
" dependent plugins:
" - kana/vim-textobj-line
" - kana/vim-textobj-indent
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-user'

" line (inner `il` & around `al`)
"
" adds two text objects:
" - `<operator>il` - delete line from level of indentation
" - `<operator>al` - delete full line (including whitespace, `dal` <> `dd`)
"
" usage:
" ```
" // `dal` & `dil` do the same on the below line
" text here
"   // on example 'some indented text here' line below
"   // `dal` deletes whole line including whitespace (same effect as `cc`)
"   // `dil` preserves the white space and deletes everything else
"   some indented text here
" more text here
" ```
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-line'

" indents
"
" `<operator>ii` - operates on all lines at same indentation above and below
"   cursor line. Selection stops at empty lines or lines with different
"   indentation.
" `<operator>ai` - operates on all lines at same or greater indentation above
"   and below cursor line. Selection stops at lines with lesser indentation, NOT
"   at empty lines or lines with greater indentation.
"
" See more details and helpful detailed diagrams of the effect of different
" selections w/ code examples:
" ref - http://kana.github.io/config/vim/textobj-indent.html
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-indent'

" entire document - `<operator>ae`
" `ae` - entire contents of buffer (slightly shorter version of `ggdG`)
" `ie` - contents of buffer minus leading/trailing whitespace
