" < operators >

" edit surrounding characters
"
" - `ys<motion/text object><character>` - surround with given character. For
"     example, `ysiw'` on `word` will add surrounding `'`s -> `'word'`.
" - `ds<character>` - delete nearest (innermost) surrounding pair of given
"     character. For example, `ds(` on `(word)` will delete surrounding `()`s ->
"     `word`.
" - `cs<character-to-replace><new-character>` - change nearest (innermost)
"     surrounding pair of valid surrounding characters into any other valid
"     surrounding character pairing. For example, `cs"}` on `"word"` changes the
"     `"`s into `{}` -> `{word}`
